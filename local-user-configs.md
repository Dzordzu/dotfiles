# local-user-configs

## Style guide
1. Each user SHOULD handle configs in `.config` directory. If it's possible, configs SHOULD be modularized.  
2. Every file that is run as shell executable, should use `. config/program/module`
3. There CAN be more levels of modularization

## Tips and tricks
1. When cou CAN'T modularize a file, you MIGHT find or create generator for it
2. Use `ln` command in order to "keep" proper files in the correct directory
