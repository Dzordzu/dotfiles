## Own bin

### Reason
Some scripts are quite sensitive. You want to keep them in a single place, organized by subject etc. This place is for them. You want to type a single command in order to ssh to certain host? A `hosts` dir is for you. Got something more private? A `private` dir is where you go

All of them are added to your PATH, thanks to ddf-install-basic script
